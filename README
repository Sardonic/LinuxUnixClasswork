This is some old classwork from a course I took Junior year of college (that's
third-year, for those outside the US). It contains a character driver that is
instrumental in playing a networked "game." The client and server code for that
game is also available in the repo.

I'm hoping this is the most recent version of everything, but some of this might
be half-finished. If it is, then unfortunately the rest of the work is lost
forever.

I didn't clean up anything in the repository, for fear of losing something
important. There are definitely some binaries in the repo that could be removed,
but again, I haven't touched this stuff in a while and would rather play it
safe.

Feel free to download and poke around for educational purposes. Please don't
redistribute anything without attribution, and definitely don't redistribute
without including the source code.
